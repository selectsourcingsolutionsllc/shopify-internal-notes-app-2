 comprehensive numbered list of the most common Railway deployment failures:

Missing or Incorrect Start Command

"ERROR: No start command detected" or "Error: Cannot find module 'index.js'"
The deployment build may succeed, but the service fails to start because Railway cannot determine how to execute the application. This typically occurs when there's no start script defined in package.json, no Procfile present, or the entry point file specified doesn't exist at the expected path.
Add a start command in your package.json scripts section, create a Procfile with the correct start command, or configure the start command directly in Railway's service settings. Verify that the entry point file path matches what's specified in your configuration.

Port Binding Failure

"Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000" or "Application failed to respond on PORT"
The application is attempting to bind to a hardcoded port instead of using the dynamic PORT environment variable that Railway provides. Railway assigns a random port at runtime and expects applications to listen on that port, but many developers hardcode ports like 3000 or 8080 during local development.
Modify your application to read the port from the PORT environment variable with a fallback for local development, such as using process.env.PORT or equivalent in your language. Ensure the application binds to 0.0.0.0 rather than localhost to accept external connections.

Build Command Execution Failure

"npm ERR! missing script: build" or "error: failed to compile"
The build process is attempting to execute a command that either doesn't exist in your configuration or fails due to syntax errors, missing dependencies, or incompatible versions. This prevents the deployment from completing the build phase before it can even attempt to start the service.
Check that your build script exists in package.json or your configuration file, verify all build dependencies are properly listed, and ensure your code compiles without errors in a clean environment. Review build logs carefully to identify the specific compilation or transpilation error.

Missing Environment Variables

"Error: DATABASE_URL is not defined" or "Configuration error: Missing required environment variable"
The application requires certain environment variables to function but those variables haven't been set in the Railway project settings. Applications often fail immediately on startup when they attempt to access critical configuration values like database URLs, API keys, or service endpoints that don't exist.
Navigate to your Railway project's Variables section and add all required environment variables with their appropriate values. Reference your application's documentation or local .env file to ensure you're not missing any critical configuration values. Remember that Railway doesn't automatically import .env files.

Dependency Installation Failure

"npm ERR! 404 Not Found" or "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement"
The package manager cannot locate or install one or more declared dependencies, either because package names are misspelled, versions don't exist, private packages lack authentication, or there's a network issue accessing the package registry. This prevents the build from completing successfully.
Verify all dependency names and versions are correct in your package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent file. For private packages, ensure authentication tokens are properly configured as environment variables. Clear any lock files if version conflicts exist and regenerate them locally before deploying.

Memory Limit Exceeded

"JavaScript heap out of memory" or "Killed" or "Process exited with code 137"
The application or build process is consuming more memory than allocated by the Railway plan, causing the system to terminate the process. This commonly occurs during build steps with large asset compilation, or at runtime when the application handles memory-intensive operations without proper resource management.
Optimize your build process to reduce memory consumption, consider upgrading to a Railway plan with higher memory limits, or implement memory management best practices in your code. For Node.js, you can increase heap size using NODE_OPTIONS environment variable, though this requires staying within plan limits.

Health Check Timeout

"Health check failed: connection timeout" or "Service failed to become healthy within allocated time"
Railway attempts to verify the service is running by sending requests to it, but the application doesn't respond within the expected timeframe. This can happen when the application takes too long to initialize, isn't listening on the correct port, or has startup processes that block the main thread.
Ensure your application responds quickly to HTTP requests on the assigned PORT, reduce startup time by deferring non-critical initialization tasks, or adjust health check settings if available. Verify that database connections and external service dependencies don't block the application from accepting requests.

Database Connection Refused

"ECONNREFUSED" or "Error: connect ETIMEDOUT" or "could not connect to server"
The application cannot establish a connection to the database service, either because the database URL is incorrect, the database service isn't running, network policies are blocking the connection, or the database credentials are invalid. This prevents any database-dependent operations from functioning.
Verify the DATABASE_URL or equivalent connection string is correctly formatted and contains valid credentials. Ensure the database service is deployed and running in Railway, check that the database is accessible from your application's network context, and confirm firewall rules or service-to-service communication is properly configured.

Buildpack Detection Failure

"Unable to detect buildpack" or "No buildpack found for this application"
Railway cannot automatically determine what type of application it's building, usually because critical files that indicate the project type are missing or in unexpected locations. Without proper detection, Railway doesn't know which build tools and runtime to use.
Add clear indicators of your application type by ensuring files like package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, or similar are in the project root. Alternatively, explicitly specify a buildpack or use a Dockerfile to give Railway exact build instructions. Verify your project structure matches standard conventions for your framework.

File Permission Errors

"EACCES: permission denied" or "Operation not permitted"
The deployment process or running application is attempting to access, modify, or execute files without sufficient permissions. Container environments typically run with restricted user privileges, and certain file operations that work locally may be blocked in production.
Ensure your application doesn't require write access to its own directory at runtime, use appropriate directories like /tmp for temporary files, and verify executable files have proper permissions set before deployment. If using Docker, review your Dockerfile's USER directive and file ownership configuration.

Build Timeout

"Build exceeded maximum time limit" or "Build cancelled: timeout reached"
The build process is taking too long to complete and Railway terminates it to prevent resource exhaustion. This typically happens with extremely large dependency trees, complex compilation steps, or when build scripts include time-consuming operations like running full test suites.
Optimize your build by removing unnecessary dependencies, excluding test runs from the build step, leveraging caching effectively, or splitting complex builds into multiple stages. Consider whether certain build steps can be moved to post-deployment or handled differently to reduce build time.

Docker Image Build Failure

"ERROR: failed to solve" or "dockerfile parse error" or "COPY failed: no source files"
When using a custom Dockerfile, syntax errors, incorrect commands, missing source files, or invalid base images prevent the Docker image from being built successfully. Docker builds are strict and fail fast when encountering configuration problems.
Review your Dockerfile syntax against Docker documentation, ensure all COPY and ADD commands reference files that exist in your repository, verify base image tags are valid and accessible, and test your Docker build locally before deploying. Check that .dockerignore isn't excluding necessary files.

Missing Static Files or Assets

"404 Not Found" for assets or "Module not found: Can't resolve './public/'"
Build artifacts, static assets, or generated files that the application expects to be present are missing in the deployed environment. This happens when build outputs are in directories not included in the deployment, or when build steps that generate these files don't execute properly.
Ensure your build process generates all necessary files and that they're placed in locations included in the deployment. Verify that build output directories aren't excluded by .gitignore or similar files. Check that asset compilation steps complete successfully and output to the correct locations.

Runtime Version Mismatch

"engine "node" is incompatible" or "Unsupported Python version" or "required version not available"
The application specifies a runtime version that isn't available on Railway, or there's a mismatch between the version used locally and what gets installed during deployment. This causes the application to either fail to install or behave unexpectedly due to version differences.
Explicitly specify supported runtime versions in your configuration files like package.json engines field, .node-version, .python-version, or runtime.txt. Verify the requested version is available on Railway and matches what you're using in development. Keep version specifications reasonable rather than overly restrictive.

Native Dependency Compilation Failure

"node-gyp: build error" or "error: failed building wheel" or "fatal error: missing required headers"
Native dependencies that require compilation during installation are failing because necessary build tools, compilers, or system libraries aren't available in the build environment. This commonly affects packages with C/C++ extensions or Python packages with native code.
Check if alternative pure-JavaScript or pure-Python versions of the packages exist. If native dependencies are necessary, ensure the build environment has required tools installed, consider using precompiled binaries when available, or use a custom Docker image with the necessary build dependencies pre-installed.

Database Migration Failure

"migration failed: table already exists" or "Migration error: syntax error" or "Cannot acquire connection from pool"
Database schema migrations that run during deployment are failing due to syntax errors in migration files, conflicts with existing schema state, connection issues, or insufficient database permissions. Failed migrations often prevent the application from starting since the database schema doesn't match expectations.
Review migration files for errors, ensure migrations are designed to be idempotent when possible, verify database connection credentials have sufficient permissions, and consider running migrations as a separate deployment step rather than during application startup. Test migrations against a staging database first.

SSL Certificate or TLS Issues

"certificate verify failed" or "SSL routines: wrong version number" or "unable to verify the first certificate"
The application is attempting to make HTTPS connections to external services but encounters certificate validation problems, protocol mismatches, or missing root certificates. Modern security requirements mean invalid SSL configurations often result in complete connection failures rather than warnings.
Ensure your runtime environment includes up-to-date root certificates, verify you're using HTTPS URLs correctly where required, check that external services you're connecting to have valid certificates, and review any custom SSL configuration in your application code. For legacy systems, you may need to update SSL/TLS protocol versions.

Network Connectivity or DNS Resolution Failure

"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND" or "dial tcp: lookup failed" or "network unreachable"
The application cannot resolve hostnames or establish network connections to external services, either due to DNS configuration issues, firewall restrictions, incorrect URLs, or transient network problems. This prevents integration with external APIs, databases, or services.
Verify all external service URLs are correct and use fully qualified domain names, ensure DNS is functioning properly by checking basic connectivity, review Railway's egress policies if applicable, and implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient network issues. Check that services you're trying to reach are actually running and accessible.

Disk Space Exhausted

"no space left on device" or "disk quota exceeded" or "write ENOSPC"
The deployment or running application has consumed all available disk space allocated to it, preventing further write operations. This can happen from logging excessively, storing uploaded files without cleanup, building extremely large artifacts, or not properly managing temporary files.
Implement log rotation or reduce logging verbosity, clean up temporary files regularly, avoid storing uploads to the local filesystem and use external storage services instead, and review what's consuming disk space during builds. Consider upgrading your Railway plan if legitimate application needs exceed current limits.

Procfile Configuration Error

"Cannot parse Procfile" or "Process type 'web' not found" or "Procfile command failed"
The Procfile used to define how processes should run contains syntax errors, references process types incorrectly, or specifies commands that don't exist or fail to execute. Railway relies on Procfile to know how to start different application processes.
Review Procfile syntax ensuring it follows the correct format of "processtype: command", verify that commands reference valid executables or scripts, avoid complex shell operations that might fail in the container environment, and test commands work when executed directly. Ensure the web process is defined if running a web service.
